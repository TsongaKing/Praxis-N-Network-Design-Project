# Praxis-N2-Network-Design-Project

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Praxis N2 (HPXN200-1) Formative Assessment 1, covering various aspects of network design, troubleshooting, and implementation.

## Project Components

### Question 1: Branch Office Network Design
- **Hybrid Star Topology**: Central core switch with VLAN segmentation for traffic isolation
- **QoS Implementation**: DSCP prioritization for VoIP and cloud applications
- **Hardware Selection**: Cisco Catalyst 9300 switches with PoE+ support
- **Redundancy**: Dual WAN links with HSRP failover

### Question 2: Structured Cabling Plan
- **ANSI/TIA/EIA 568 Standard**: Comprehensive structured cabling design
- **Subsystems**: Entrance facility, equipment room, telecommunications rooms, horizontal/backbone cabling
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Temperature, humidity, power quality, and security considerations

### Question 3: Ethernet Switch Evaluation
- **Switch Categories**: Unmanaged, Smart, and Managed switches
- **Comparison**: Features, scalability, and use cases
- **Future-Proofing**: Managed switches with SDN support and firmware upgradability

### Question 4: Routing Table Parameters
- **Key Parameters**: Destination network, subnet mask, next hop, interface, metric, administrative distance
- **Visual Representation**: Packet routing flowchart
- **Routing Protocols**: How OSPF, RIP, and BGP utilize routing parameters
